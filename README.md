This repository contained an ETL webscrapping project.

We scrapped crime statistics (particularly offence number) for the years of 2015-2019.

We sourced data from Canada, USA and England in the form of APIs and CSVs.

THe data was then converted to a pandas data frame that could be exported to a CSV.
